        <span style="font-weight: normal;"><br/></span>
        <span style="font-weight: normal;">The words, or a sequence of words are seen as a market, in which the Google clients have to take positions, without having the knowledge of the positions of the other bid competitors!

        <hr/>
        Human factor is the factor who can ...
        <br/>
        I think it is the worst risk! As I can see from my life, the humans are:
        <br/>
        <ul>
            <li>Weak:<br/>
                Soon we are able to take some decisions, in which we are the most confortable as possible. That's
                reflect
                today when we are seeing&nbsp;brilliants&nbsp;students, choose the Job or the company that's are at&nbsp;least
                risky. They
                prefer be hired by an administration, or a big company, with a long term visibility. And in occident, we
                can
                see some professions be with a less numbers of students from one year to another. See medical carrier,
                but
                the engineering too.&nbsp;We have a great propensity to take the easier options for us. This reveals a
                lack of motivation that seems very sad.
            </li>
            <li>Easy to corrupt:<br/>
                Everybody can think that's not true! But from how money ? There's not a sum beyond which you will be
                able to
                change? I can not help thinking there is a limit of our corruptibility isn't it ?Is there a country
                today where there is no corruption? I don't think so! We live in a world where money drive everything, a
                fact that postpone our propensity to be incorruptible at least when we will be able to change of galaxy!
            </li>
            <li>Changing of opinion:<br/>
                The human being changes his opinion, it is in his nature. We sometimes doubt our certitudes often
                because the facts will show us knew another truth. Our history is full of moments when we changed! Take
                for example the look on women or homosexuals. Could it have been just imagine us centuries back that
                same-sex marriages exist?
        </ul>
        <ul><br/></ul>
        Anyway, when we are talking about privacy, we inevitably speak of trust!&nbsp;</div>
