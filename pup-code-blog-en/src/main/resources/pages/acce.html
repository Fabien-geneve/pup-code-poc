<h2>You are on the home page of the site PUP Code Initiative</h2>
<br/><br/>PUP is an acronym. It means <b>"Protect U Privacy"</b>, is of English, kind of SMS style.

<br/><br/>The initiative has for objective to <b>provide a data sharing
    solution</b>, which will be longer stored on the servers of
Google Facebook Twitter and more ...

<br/>
<br/>Today I am alone to drive this initiative. This is not a satisfactory approach from my point of view, because I
believe that the privacy protection of our lives affects all of us.

<br/><br/><b>So please, join me!</b>

<h3>You are not IT professional, I need you!</h3>

<br/>For quality purpose, I need external looks likely to criticism. So if you feel the soul of a "reviewer" or a
product owner, <a href="mailto:fabien@pupcodeinitiative.info?subject=I wanna join the PUP Code Initiative">contact
    me</a>.
The aim is to re-read the articles and pages and <b>provide constructive criticism</b>.

<br/><br/>For those who have the soul of a developer, there's something fun:

<ul>
    <li>The system will operate based agents installed on target devices (smartphone, tablet, personal computer).</li>
    <li>Technologies like HTML 5 and JavaScript should be the core of the user interfaces .</li>
    <li>Use Java for the back end, emphasizing security to be the core of the problem: in order to be
        credible, it is imperative that security is maximized.
    </li>
    <li>Java REST service microphones, based on JSON.</li>
    </li>
</ul>
<br/><br/>
So feel free to join me, the tools are already in place:
<ul>
    <li>I'm agile addict, then the SCRUM is online!</li>

    <li>Any type of profile is welcome: graphic designers, HTML developer, developer security, etcetera ... Join the
        community, and I will contact you to give you the necessary space to your expression.
    </li>

    <li>And if you do not know anything about computers, readers are essential I think everyone can participate in this
        initiative. Because the skills to get to the goal are multiple and multidisciplinary.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Two examples:</h3>
<br/><br/>I make two versions of the site, a French because I am a bit chauvinistic French!
And an English for maxize the audiency.
<br/>
<br/>However, I do see some spelling grammar mistakes. And my English although used in the workplace, is far from perfect.
Also, re-readers for articles and pages, whether in French or English are essential. And if you go on
<a href="https://srum.pupcodeinitiative.info/">SCRUM</a>, you will see that on each user story are writing tasks, but the process involves a review to describe what
has been achieved. and how to do it better the next time.

<b>So go ahead take the plunge, I need you!</b>
