    <span itemprop="articleBody">PUP is an acronym. It means <b>"Protect U Privacy"</b>, is of English, kind of SMS style.<br/>
    <br/>
    The initiative has for objective to <b>provide a data sharing
    solution</b>, which will be longer stored on the servers of
    Google Facebook Twitter and more ...


    <br/>
    <br/>
    Today I am alone to drive this initiative. This is not a satisfactory approach from my point of view, because I
    believe that the privacy protection of our lives affects all of us.

        </li>

        <a itemprop="url articleSection" href="https://www.blogger.com/null" name="exemple"></a>
        Two examples:</h3><br/>
   <span itemprop="articleBody"> I make two versions of the site:<br/>
    <ul>
        <li>a French version because I am a little bit French chauvinistic!&nbsp;</li>
        <li>And an English version in order to have maximum audience.</li>
    </ul>
    <br/>
    However, I do see some spelling grammar mistakes. And my English although used in the workplace, is far from
    perfect. An worst, it should be human at all !
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, re-readers for articles and pages, whether in <b>French or English are essential</b>. And if you go on
    <a itemprop="url" href="https://scrum.pupcodeinitiative.info/">SCRUM</a>, you will see that on each user story are writing tasks,
    but the process involves a review to describe what
    has been achieved. and how to do it better the next time.<br/>
    <b><br/></b>
    <b>So go ahead take the plunge, I need you!</b><br/>
