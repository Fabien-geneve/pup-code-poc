<h2>
    You are on the home page of the site PUP Code Initiative</h2>
<br/>
PUP is an acronym. It means <b>"Protect U Privacy"</b>, is of English, kind of SMS style.<br/>
<br/>
The initiative has for objective to <b>provide a data sharing
    solution</b>, which will be longer stored on the servers of
Google Facebook Twitter and more ...

<br/>
<br/>
Today I am alone to drive this initiative. This is not a satisfactory approach from my point of view, because I
believe that the privacy protection of our lives affects all of us.

<br/>
<br/>
<b><a href="http://community.pupcodeinitiative.info/" target="_blank">So please, join me!</a></b>

<br/>
<h3>
    You are not IT professional, I need you!</h3>
For quality purpose, I need external looks likely to criticism. So if you feel the soul of a "reviewer" or a
product owner, <a href="mailto:fabien@pupcodeinitiative.info?subject=I%20wanna%20join%20the%20PUP%20Code%20Initiative">contact
    me</a>.
The aim is to re-read the articles and pages and <b>provide constructive criticism</b>.

<br/>
<br/>
For those who have the soul of a developer, there's something fun:

<br/>
<ul>
    <li>The system will <a href="http://www.pupcodeinitiative.info/p/solution.html" target="_blank">operate based agents
        installed on target devices</a> (smartphone, tablet, personal computer).
    </li>
    <li>Technologies like HTML 5 and JavaScript should be the core of the user interfaces .</li>
    <li>Use Java for the back end, emphasizing security to be the core of the problem: in order to be
        credible, it is imperative that security is maximized.
    </li>
    <li>Java REST service microphones, based on JSON.</li>
</ul>
So feel free to join me, the tools are already in place:
<br/>
<ul>
    <li>I'm agile addict, then the <a href="https://srum.pupcodeinitiative.info/" target="_blank">SCRUM</a> is online!
    </li>
    <li>Any type of profile is welcome: graphic designers, HTML developer, developer security, etcetera ... Join the
        community, and I will contact you to give you the necessary space to your expression.
    </li>
    <li>And if you do not know anything about computers, readers are essential I think everyone can participate in this
        initiative. Because the skills to get to the goal are multiple and multidisciplinary.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Two examples:</h3>
I make two versions of the site:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>a French version because I am a little bit French chauvinistic!&nbsp;</li>
    <li>And an English version in order to have maximum audience.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
However, I do see some spelling grammar mistakes. And my English although used in the workplace, is far from perfect. An worst, it should be human at all !
<br/>
<br/>
Also, re-readers for articles and pages, whether in <b>French or English are essential</b>. And if you go on
<a href="https://srum.pupcodeinitiative.info/">SCRUM</a>, you will see that on each user story are writing tasks, but the process involves a review to describe what
has been achieved. and how to do it better the next time.<br/>
<b><br/></b>
<b>So go ahead take the plunge, I need you!</b><br/>
