<p>At this time, The community does not exist, it exist as an idea. Fabien me, I am the originator of this initiative,
    which I
    managed to aggregate two others friends:
<ol>
    <li>Friend A computer systems and networks.</li>
    <li>Another friend IT architect.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>This community, exist in the form of a Google community, along with a Facebook group. We would arrive at
    aggregating many people as possible for protecting our private data; it's a topic that concerns all of us. Maybe you
    tell
    yourself, I do not have time for that or I do not feel able to get involved! Do not dread this stuff! I need people
    very true with me: even if somebody can only read the pages and article, bring corrections will be the best. But
    also do research on the subject
    of privacy. An investment of half an hour per week, would be a valuable asset for us.</p>

<p>But you are also looking for more specific profiles: people able to provide a computer work at several levels;
<ul>
    <li>Code testers.</li>
    <li>Java developer for the party core server.</li>
    <li>Android developer.</li>
    <li>IOS developer.</li>
    <li>Platform administrators (Software Factory).</li>
    <li>Editors for blog pages.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>You can invest in your own way, and with the time you have. The principle of the community is to have everything
    online, to facilitate access and sharing. When I have time I will start up a registration form. For now <a
            href="mailto:fabien@pupcodeinititative.info?subject=Community participation">
        take contact
        with me by mail
    </a> . I will give you the information needed to get involved.</p>
