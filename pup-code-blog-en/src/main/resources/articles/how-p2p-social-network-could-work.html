    <h3>
        Create a new "Network of Friends"</h3>
    <br/>
    <h4>
        This can be split in 2 cases :</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>The PUP Code application is already installed on one or your device (Smartphone, Tablet, Laptop ...).
        </li>
        <li>The PUP Code application is not yet installed on one of your devices.</li>
    </ol>
    <div class="content">
        This mechanism ensure that each User or Peer, have a correct network configuration, and could make a
        <b>direct TCP/IP connection</b> on the other network members, <b>without transiting on a third party server on
        which
        your data could be stored"</b></div>
    <div class="content">
        In fact, these cases are the same ! Just the first case, you need to install the PUP Code application, at least
        on
        one of your devices. See the PBM diagram above, it illustrate how you could create a new "Network Friends", when
        the
        PUP Code application is already installed.
    </div>
    <h3>
        Accept an invitation to join a "Friends Network"</h3>

    <br/>

    <div class="content">
        First, the PUP Code service receive an invitation to Join a "Friends Network", <b>sent
        by the coordination server</b>. Then, when accepted, the application notify the coordination server of the user
        acceptance, and the coordination server sent the new network configuration of each Peer of the system. Each User
        or
        Peer in the System, need to accept to joint the "Friends Network".
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        This mechanism ensure that each User or Peer, have a correct network configuration, and could make a <b>direct
        TCP/IP connection</b> on the other network members, <b>without transiting on a third party server on which your
        data could be stored</b>.
