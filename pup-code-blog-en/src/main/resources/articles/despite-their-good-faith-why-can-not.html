    <h3>
        It's quite edify no? </h3>
    I did a web service, that handle some interactions on this site:
    it take all the values in your HTTP request, and track you as well! I use Cookie technology too. If you take a look
    at the information page, you can see them: pup-click-tracker, pup-code-visit. Each time you reload the page, the web
    service is called, and actualize the values you can see, but update the cookies too.<br/>
    <br/>
    If you not go to the site from severall month ago, no worries, the cookie remember for you
