<h3>
    What are the real dangers actually?</h3>
<h4>
    Think of the children</h4>
After reading this, I can not help but think of my children. They, who have grown up with these technologies, and use
them without moderation!<br/>
Are they intended to be a row in a spreadsheet? With room for improvement, but also its potential sales? And claims
that it is likely to give him and which will fly! I try to educate and it is not something easy to do.<br/>
<h4>
    What would happen in case of war?</h4>
I think the question needs to be asked! And here by misadventure the worst happened! A war for example. The states
will have there not quick to preempt the data for national security purpose ? We know that in times of war
everything is possible and the worst is to wait.<br/>
<h4>
    Over the life what it will give?</h4>
So, it's a question i can not answer for now. But one can imagine everything I think! If as predicted by Jacques
Attali, a
war this to us around 2030, our states have amassed enough data to know to sort out who should live and who must
die, I think. Positive outlook if it is! So I do not want to remain inactive before this, and two of my job I think
that other solutions may emerge, to preserve our private data.
