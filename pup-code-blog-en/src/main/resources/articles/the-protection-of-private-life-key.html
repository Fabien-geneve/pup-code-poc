<h3>
    The protection of privacy, a challenge these days:</h3>
<br/>
What are we doing today to preserve our privacy in this new digital world? We read social networks such as Facebook or Google+ more without moderation. And we are posting our moods and other stuff without worrying about what will happen to our data, in the near future but also in the more distant future!
<br/>
Also, it appears that our practices on social networks pose security challenges of tomorrow: I invite you to watch this video or a security expert (Mikko Hyppönen at USI – OCTO Technology), explains these issues. Take a few minutes to look at is quite edifying!

There was a time where all electronic devices did not exist! How we were doing then? We went to the cafe, or in a public place to meet people, our friends, our acquaintances.
<br/>
Today the situation has completely changed! With the proliferation of electronic applications on media such as telephone or tablets but also personal computers, without extent, we are posting our moods if we had a good night, or if we butt itch!
<br/>
Everything is an artifact to post, and we are so happy to share such important things in the whole world! But in the pre digital age, would we have done that? I think not! Today when we post publicly on Facebook, we ask if we would be willing to go to the village square, and with a megaphone, say we had a bad night for example.
<h3><br/>
    Some facts:</h3><br/>
The first thing appears: the Internet of the majors are now building an IT model, whose ultimate goal is to collect our data. To shape our person, and thus sell tailored advertising. You think I'm paranoid? So let's look at this a little closer:
<ul>
    <li>Google built "data center" on the planet.</li>
    <li>Facebook buys WhatsApp for $ 22 million, with the ultimate goal to correlate your Facebook profile with a phone
        number. Facebook has not purchased the application, they bought the data, that is to say, our phone number.
    </li>
    <li>Twitter, Facebook Google still without the triumvirate of these practices, but they are not alone!</li>
    <li>The statements are the first to hack our private data, all in order to protect us of course.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
I think businesses are there to make money it is their goal. They can not survive without money, and thus repay us our wages. So when she can do so without pain for us, they do! All because of the “I Agree syndrome”.
<br/><br/>
Who takes the time to read the Terms and Conditions applications? Nobody actually somehow you have already paid for the software, and especially for those that are free. You no longer have a choice!
<br/><br/>
I think there is no fate, and that alternatives may exist and even I would have to exist. So I invite you to join forces with mine for and b ready for change!
<br/><br/>
With IT professional for over 15 years, other models may exist. Take for example peer-to-peer model: a long time ago used to share music film also often hacked!
<br/><br/>
Why not put it to good use model for our data exchanges on social networks? After all our private data do not necessarily have to pass on third-party servers. scattered in the cloud, and we don't know where they are !Google Facebook and other know where our data, we involuntary these clients profiling practices.
