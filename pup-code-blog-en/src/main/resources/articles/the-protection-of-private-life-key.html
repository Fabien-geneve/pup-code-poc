        The protection of privacy, a challenge these days:</h3>
    <br/>
<span itemprop="articleBody" class="pmr-blogposting-articlebody">
What are we doing today to <b>preserve our privacy</b> in this new digital world? We read social networks such as Facebook or Google+ more without moderation.<br/>
<br/>
And we are posting our moods and other stuff without worrying about what will happen to our data, in the near future but also in the more distant future!
<br/>
<br/>
Also, it appears that <b>our practices on social networks are security challenges of tomorrow</b>: I invite you to watch this video or a security expert (Mikko Hyppönen at USI – OCTO Technology), explains these issues. Take a few minutes to look at is quite edifying!

There was a time, where all electronic devices did not exist! How we were doing then? We went to the cafe, or in a public place to meet people, our friends, our acquaintances.
<br/>
<br/>
Today the situation has completely changed! With the <b>proliferation of electronic
    applications</b> on media such as <b>telephone or tablets but also personal computers</b>, without extent, <b>we are
    posting our moods</b> if we had a good night, or if we butt itch!
<br/>
<br/>
Everything is an artifact to be posted, and we are so happy to share such important things in the whole world!<br/>
<br/>
But in the pre digital age, would we have done that? I think not! Today when we post publicly on Facebook, we ask if we would be willing to go to the village square, and with a megaphone, say we had a bad night for example.<br/></span>

        Some facts:</h3>
    <br/>
<span itemprop="articleBody">
The first thing appears: the Internet of t<b>he majors are now building an IT model</b>, whose ultimate goal is to <b>collect
    our
    data</b>. To shape our person, and thus sell tailored advertising. You think I'm paranoid? So let's look at this a little closer:
<br/>
<ul>
    <li>Google built "data center" on the planet.</li>
    <li>Facebook buys WhatsApp for<b> $ 22 million,</b> with the ultimate goal <b>to correlate your Facebook profile
        with a phone
        number</b>. Facebook has not purchased the application, t<b>hey bought the data,</b> that is to say,<b> our
        phone number</b>.
    </li>
    <li>Twitter, Facebook Google still without the triumvirate of these practices, but they are not alone!</li>
    <li><b>The statements are the first to hack our private data</b>, all in order to protect us of course.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
I think <b>businesses are there to make
    money</b> it is their goal. They can not survive without money, and thus repay us our wages. So when she can do <b>so
    without pain for us,</b> they do it! All because of the <b>“I Agree syndrome”</b>.
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Who takes the time to read the Terms and Conditions applications? Nobody actually somehow you have already paid for
    the software, and especially for those that are free. You no longer have a choice!
</b><br/>
<br/>
I think t<b>here is no fate</b>, and that alternatives may exist and even should have to exist. So I invite you to <b>join
    forces with mine, and be ready for change</b>!
<br/>
<br/>
With IT professional for over 15 years, other models may exist. Take for example <b>peer-to-peer
    model</b>: a long time ago used to share music film also often hacked!
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Why not put it to good use model for our data exchanges on social networks?</b> After all our <b>private data do not
    necessarily have to pass on third-party
    servers,</b>&nbsp;set up in the cloud, and we don't know where they are! Google Facebook and other know where are our data, we&nbsp;are the involuntary clients of these &nbsp;profiling practices.</span>
