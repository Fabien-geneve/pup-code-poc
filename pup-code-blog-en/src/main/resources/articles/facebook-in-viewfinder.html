        When we talk about protecting privacy, how not to talk about Facebook?
        About Privacy</h3>
    <span itemprop="articleBody">
    This firm, mounted by a student, was the trigger for the digital social revolution: that's when it first appeared,
    people began to share everything and anything on the Web, without discernment! Initially all the world thought it
    was so cool, no need to see your friends, they are all ready in my Smartphone! In addition, if they agree, I can
    locate my friends! But no more opaque in these practices as Facebook, on many articles on the web are there to
    remind us: <a

        What are the real dangers actually?</h3>
<span itemprop="articleBody">

    <h4 itemprop="articleSection">
<span itemprop="articleBody">
    Think of the children</span></h4>
<span itemprop="articleBody">
After reading this, I can not help but think of my children. They, who have grown up with these technologies, and use
them without moderation!<br/>
Are they intended to be a row in a spreadsheet? With room for improvement, but also its potential sales? And claims
that it is likely to give him and which will fly! I try to educate and it is not something easy to do.<br/></span>
<h4 itemprop="articleSection">
    What would happen in case of war?</h4>
    <span itemprop="articleBody">
I think the question needs to be asked! And here by misadventure the worst happened! A war for example. The states
will have there not quick to preempt the data for national security purpose ? We know that in times of war
everything is possible and the worst is to wait.<br/></span>
<h4 itemprop="articleSection">
    Over the life what it will give?</h4>
    <span itemprop="articleBody">
So, it's a question i can not answer for now. But one can imagine everything I think! If as predicted by Jacques
Attali, a
war this to us around 2030, our states have amassed enough data to know to sort out who should live and who must
die, I think. Positive outlook if it is! So I do not want to remain inactive before this, and two of my job I think
that other solutions may emerge, to preserve our private data.
